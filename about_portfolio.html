        Welcome to my personal game development portfolio! 
        <br>
        This site showcases a collection of projects I’ve built in my spare time, ranging from small experiments to more polished games.<br> Each project reflects both my current skills and my ongoing improvement and dedication to game development
        It’s a space that grows alongside my experience and skills. <br>I’ll continue adding new work and updates as I develop my abilities and explore new ideas.

      <h2>About Me  <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-user"></i></h2><br>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Grant - full name Douglas Grant Heath,<br><br>
         I'm a Computer Programming student at Durham College, where I learned about full stack development, databases, mainframes, PC hardware, web development, and more. 
        But what captured my interest the most in software development was the ability to bring ideas to life and be able to interact with them.
        <br><br>
        This paired with my existing love for games made it clear that I wanted to focus on game development instead of any other field in tech.
        <br><br>
        Since my education at Durham College didn't deeply cover game development, I started learning on my own in the early months of 2025 using Unity.
        I started creating personal projects using online resources like YouTube, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Unity Official Documentation. These projects haven't 
        just helped me learn the basics of game development but they've forced me to make mistakes and learn new things and new troubleshooting techniques which have made me grow as both a developer and programmer.
        <br><br>
        Because of my education at Durham College it has provided me with pretty strong programming fundamentals, which made the learning curve of game development a 
        bit easier but, there are always new things to learn in making games and many easier and/or more efficient ways to do things which I am still learning.
        <br><br>
        Game development is a never ending learning curve that I am still very new to, but I am extremely passionate and excited about learning and improving, and I 
        hope this portfolio shows both where ive started and where I'm heading in my game development adventure.
