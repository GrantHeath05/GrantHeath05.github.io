    <h3>Game Idea</h3>
    <p>
      The idea for this game is the player lives in a junk yard where they can explore and collect junk. Junk can be sold or reused to get money or new items. <br>
      The more money and success the user has the more money they can invest into the junkyard to continue to grow the business.
    </p>

    <!-- Section: Game Rules or Mechanics -->
    <h3>Player Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Walking</strong> - the player can move freely in all directions since the game uses a top-down, bird’s-eye camera view using WASD or Arrows. </li>
      <li><strong>Inventory System</strong> - will be able to store multiple small items in inventory or 1 medium item in hands.</li>
     <li><strong>Large Item Handling</strong> - current plan is to add a forklift for transporting 1 large item at a time</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- Section: Game Rules or Mechanics -->
    <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales</strong> - player will be able to quick sell items for a fixed price</li>
      <li><strong>Auctions</strong> - Auction system will allow the player to potentially sell items for a larger amount but it will take longer and has a chance to sell for less</li>
      <li><strong>Scrap for Parts</strong> - Crafting system to unlock new parts of the game, can craft things like a forklift</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>People Involved in Project</h3>
    <p>
      For this project I will personally be doing everything from scratch on my own. I am not an artist so im learning as I go.

     <!--Character Customization-->
    <h2>Character Customization</h2>
    <p>
      One of my main goals for this project is to challenge myself and try new things, which is why I decided to make the player fully customizable. This includes different skin tones, clothing, hats, hairstyles, and facial features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I’m not an artist and creating a player sprite from scratch is already a challenge, I approached it in a modular way. I first created a blank white base sprite for the player, 
      then in Unity I will tint each individual piece of the player. For other layers such as the shirt, pants, hair, and face, I made separate objects so that each part can be tinted and customized individually. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Im not too sure how most games do it, but this approach is the easiest way I could think of to accomplish a fully customizable character.
