    <!-- Section: Game Info -->
    <h3>Game Idea</h3>
    <p>
      The idea for this game is the player lives in a junk yard where they can explore and collect junk. Junk can be sold or reused to get money or new items. <br>
      The more money and success the user has the more money they can invest into the junkyard to continue to grow the business.
    </p>

    <!-- Section: Game Rules or Mechanics -->
    <h3>Player Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Walking</strong> - the player can move freely in all directions since the game uses a top-down, birdâ€™s-eye camera view using WASD or Arrows. </li>
      <li><strong>Inventory System</strong> - will be able to store multiple small items in inventory or 1 medium item in hands.</li>
     <li><strong>Large Item Handling</strong> - current plan is to add a forklift for transporting 1 large item at a time</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- Section: Game Rules or Mechanics -->
    <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales</strong> - player will be able to quick sell items for a fixed price</li>
      <li><strong>Auctions</strong> - Auction system will allow the player to potentially sell items for a larger amount but it will take longer and has a chance to sell for less</li>
      <li><strong>Scrap for Parts</strong> - Crafting system to unlock new parts of the game, can craft things like a forklift</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section: Development Plan -->
    <h3>Development Plan / Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Free roam property simular to stardew valley which the user can explore and collect junk to resell/reuse to craft things. The player can sleep to skip to the next day where more junk will spawn.
    </p>
