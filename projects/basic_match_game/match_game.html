    <h3>Game Info</h3>
    <p>
      This solo project is meant to be a fun little challenege to kill some time so to make it harder I decided to set a 24-hour limit to build a playable memory match game, aiming for something fun, functional, and clean. 
      The goal: flip cards, find pairs, and clear the board with as few attempts as possible.

    <h3>Rules / Core Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanic 1:</strong> Generates a grid of shuffled cards</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanic 2:</strong> lets the user flip cards when pressed</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanic 3:</strong> when user flips to matching cards they are removed</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>

    <!-- Section: Development Plan -->
    <h3>Development Plan / Concept</h3>
    <p>
        The game will generate a grid of flipped cards, the player can click two cards at once to flip them, if they match they are removed from the grid, if they dont match they are reflipped and the player gets to try again. 
        the goal is to remove all cards from the grid. Amount of attempts are tracked and the goal is to finish the grid in the shortest amount of attempts as possible.

    <!-- Section: Post-Project Comments -->
    <h3>Comments After Project</h3>
    <p>
      The hardest part about making this game was to track each cards value and remove them from the grid without making everything shift.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I was to expand on this game I could add features like highscore tracking and more card types, but since this is meant to be just a fun little practice project I might not do that.
