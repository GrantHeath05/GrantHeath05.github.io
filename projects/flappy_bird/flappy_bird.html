    <p><br>
      The goal for this project is to make Flappy Bird without any tutorials or any help,
      I want to make everything from scratch—from code to the assets. Flappy Bird is a 
      relatively simple game but it forces me to implement features like gravity completely on my own, so it seems like a good starting point.

      <br><br>

      The first thing I did for this project was create some assets to be used. I don't have any experience creating assets from scratch, but I thought it would be a cool way to make this project more unique, so I tried my best in Microsoft Paint.
    </p>

    <!-- Assets link -->
    <div class="text-left mt-4">
      <a href="assets/flappy_bird_assets.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">
        Custom Flappy Bird Assets Page</a>
    </div>

    <p><br>
      Now that I have the basic assets created, I then started on the movement script.
      The movement script itself is pretty simple—the bird is always going down because of gravity, but if the user presses space it jumps up.
      The jump has to be strong enough to not get overpowered by the gravity, and the gravity has to be strong enough to make it fun.

    <h3>Pipe Object</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <p style="margin-right: 15px;">
        Now that the player can jump and fall, the next major step was to create the actual obstacles.
        Using the pipe assets I made in Microsoft Paint earlier, I created the pipe object. The pipe object is just two pipes which have box colliders and tags called 'obstacle',
        and an invisible box collider in the middle used as a trigger with the tag 'goal'.<br>
        While adding the obstacle tag to the pipe obstacle, I also added the same tag to the ground.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Pipe Movement</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <p style="margin-right: 15px;">
        Now that I have the pipe object, I need to make the pipe move left for a certain amount of time then despawn. The variables I decided worked best for the size of map I'm using were a lifespan of 10 seconds and a move speed of 8f.
        All the script does is constantly move the pipe object to the left while a timer variable counts up every second. Once the timer gets larger than the lifetime variable, it destroys the pipe.
        I might add to this script later to make the pipes move faster the higher your score is, but for now, having it move and despawn is enough.
      </p>

    <h3>Pipe Spawner</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <p style="margin-right: 15px;">
        I then created the Pipe Spawner object in the middle of the game which spawns the pipe object on the right-hand side at a random Y level between a range.
        The range might be altered later but I started off using -2f to 4f from the object. This will spawn the pipe on the right side, and because of the movement script and obstacle tag, it makes the pipe work the same as original Flappy Bird.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Collision Tracking</h3>
    <p>
      Now that I have the tags set up, I can track collision. There are two types of tags for collision: 
      goal and obstacle. If the bird hits a goal obstacle, currentScore should raise by 1, but if the bird hits an obstacle tag, the game should end—and if the currentScore is larger than highScore, then highScore should be updated.
      Also, since I'm now tracking score, I made a new asset for displaying high score and current score.
    </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
    <p>
      Currently the game tracks and updates score as intended. HighScore is being tracked and updated at the end of each round, and everything is running smoothly, but there are still some features I want to add before I consider this game finished. 
      Currently, when you lose, the game just freezes and a Debug.Log says "Game has ended", so I want to add a proper Game Over screen and a try again button to reset the game without actually restarting it. Also, when the game starts, there should be some kind of button to start the round—
      currently, the second the game starts the player will start falling, and if they don't jump in time, they automatically hit the ground and lose. So I think I will make it so when it starts you have to press space to actually start the round.
      <br><br>
      I also updated the sprite for the third time because I found the old one super weird looking and kind of creepy.
      <br><br>
      The left GIF below is the screen that appears when you first launch the game, and the GIF on the right shows the replay screen after death. The game is now replayable and feels like the original Flappy Bird.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Even though Flappy Bird is a simple game, I'm very proud of the mechanics—they feel just like the original Flappy Bird, which was the goal. Also, I'm very happy with how the sprites turned out, since I've never made any art or assets for anything before.<br><br>

      This project made me learn more about spawning objects in and using them as obstacles, which is something I can use for many games in the future. It also just made me more comfortable with Unity as a tool and game development libraries that I've either never used before or have minimal experience with—which was super useful.
      I am now a bit more confident with my abilities in Unity and am extremely excited to start my next project, which as of now I am planning on making Tetris.
