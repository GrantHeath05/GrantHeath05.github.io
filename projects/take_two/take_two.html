    <h3>Game Jam Theme & Info</h3>
    <p>
      This Game Jam is Hosted by Ducky Dev & Jacksepticeye 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Theme for this Game Jam is "Death is an Opportunity."  
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Game Jam Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Submission:</strong> You could work solo or in a team using any game engine.</li>
      <li><strong>Controls:</strong> All games had to be playable on Windows 10/11 using mouse and keyboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Guidelines:</strong> No NSFW, overly graphic, or hateful material allowed.</li>
      <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Pre-made assets were allowed as long as you owned the rights and did not create them in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Use:</strong> Generative AI tools were not permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Judging Categories:</strong> Overall, Enjoyment, Creativity, Theme, and Visuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h3>People Involved in Project:</h3>
    <p>
      For this game jam, I collaborated with an artist friend who created all the visual assets. 
      My role covered all aspects of game development, including programming, level design, player movement, and obstacle mechanics within Unity. 
      The artist provided the sprite art as PNG files, and I handled their implementation and animation in the engine.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Plan Before Development</h3>
    <p>
      Our interpretation centered around using death not as failure, but as a gameplay mechanic that drives progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea was to create a puzzle-platformer where death itself plays a central role in solving challenges. 
      When players die, they’re transported to an alternate "deadzone" dimension — a mirrored version of the main level containing new obstacles and hidden buttons that allow progress in the living world. 
      This design encourages players to use death strategically, creating a balance between moments where dying is beneficial and times where staying alive is crucial. 
    </p>

      <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">Very rough sketch of concept</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Balancing these mechanics would normally take a lot of fine-tuning, but given the time limit, our focus was on getting the concept functional rather than perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the 5-day time limit, development needed to be fast-paced and focused. We aimed to produce a complete, playable version of the concept that worked both as a web build and a downloadable game.  
      The game was developed entirely in Unity, utilizing its animation tools and the Input System for controls.
      We might continue this project later on, using a different itch.io page, but the one at the top of this page will remain in the state it was for the game jam.
    </p>

    <h3>Comments After Project Submission</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, the project turned out well given the short development window. However, there were a few areas I’d like to improve if we continue development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some players found the game too difficult, mainly because of the player’s speed and tendency to slide off platforms. These issues could easily be fixed by slightly lowering the movement speed and switching from a capsule collider to a box collider for tighter movement control.  
    </p>
    <p>
      During development, I intentionally made the controls more difficult to increase the challenge, but in hindsight, this made the first level too punishing — especially since there are only two levels (including the tutorial).  
      If we continue this project, I’ll rebalance the early gameplay to make it more accessible while keeping the intended level of difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I’d like to change is how death currently works. Right now, dying has no real consequence, so I’ve been thinking about flipping the concept — instead of using the deadzone to find hidden buttons, you’d have to escape it to reclaim your body.  
      It would be somewhat similar to Hollow Knight’s shade system, where dying creates a risk/reward loop: if you die again before escaping, you lose progress and restart the level. I think that would make the mechanic more meaningful and fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though this game is far from perfect, I’m extremely proud of what we accomplished in just five days. This was my first fully original game built completely from scratch using custom assets, and I’m proud of how much we got done under pressure.  
      The jam was definitely stressful, but I learned a lot about Unity’s built-in animation and input systems. If I continue developing this game, I also plan to learn Unity’s particle system to help bring the world to life — I just ran out of time during the jam.
